# odin-recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project.
The goal of this project is to build a simple recipe website using only HTML.

The website will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes. Each recipe page will include headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Structuring an HTML project
- Using basic HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, links, lists, images)
- Creating and navigating between multiple pages
- Writing clean and organized code

## Reflection
(Coming soon - I'll update this after completing the project to review what I learned.)
