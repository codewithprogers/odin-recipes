          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Takeout style crispy pan fried chicken tossed in a sweet and spicy Asian style glaze.</p>

          <p>This is one of my absolute favorite Asian main courses to make at home. I like to serve this chicken over steamed white rice. You can also serve this dish with chow mein, steamed veggies, a fresh salad, and so much more!</p>

          <p>This recipe serves about 2-4 people depending on everyones appetite. If you are cooking for a large crowd, simply double the recipe! If you are cooking for a small crowd, not to worry this chicken makes amazing leftovers! Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days.</p>
