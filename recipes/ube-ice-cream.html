        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This ube ice cream recipe must be one of the easiest recipes I've ever made. I swear by this no-churn ice cream method using whipped cream and condensed milk because it's quick, easy, and the resulting ice cream always turns out well. The tiny air pockets in the whipped cream and the sugar in the condensed milk both work together to prevent the ice cream from becoming icy or hard once frozen so it's just as good as store-bought ice cream.</p>
        <p>Ube is a purple yam or purple sweet potato commonly found in the Phillippines and Southeast Asia. Ube is known for its natural distinctly vibrant purple colour. It has a sweet and mellow flavour and aroma similar to vanilla and coconut.</p>
