        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>600 g heavy cream, cold</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon ube extract</li>
          <li>375 g sweetened condensed milk, (one 14oz can)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This ube ice cream recipe must be one of the easiest recipes I've ever made. I swear by this no-churn ice cream method using whipped cream and condensed milk because it's quick, easy, and the resulting ice cream always turns out well. The tiny air pockets in the whipped cream and the sugar in the condensed milk both work together to prevent the ice cream from becoming icy or hard once frozen so it's just as good as store-bought ice cream.</p>
        <p>Ube is a purple yam or purple sweet potato commonly found in the Phillippines and Southeast Asia. Ube is known for its natural distinctly vibrant purple colour. It has a sweet and mellow flavour and aroma similar to vanilla and coconut.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Whip cream:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, add the heavy cream and ube extract. Use an electric hand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment to beat the cream until it becomes stiff peaks.</li>
          <li><strong>Fold in condensed milk:</strong> Slowly drizzle the condensed milk into the cream while folding it in with a spatula in your other hand until no streaks remain. Don't overmix as you don't want to deflate all the air in the whipped cream.</li>
          <li><strong>Freeze:</strong> Pour this mixture into a loaf pan. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and freeze overnight.</li>
          <li><strong>Scoop:</strong> When serving, run your ice cream scooper under hot water and pat dry before scooping.</li>
